# Collide ‚Äî Physics Puzzle Game Prototype

**Collide** is a physics-based puzzle game prototype built using [Flet](https://flet.dev), a Python UI framework for building desktop, web, and mobile apps with Flutter-like components.

The game features two modes:
- **Puzzle Mode:** Draw lines to guide a falling ball into a randomly placed target.
- **Simulator Mode:** Set the number and size of balls, then simulate free-fall and collisions.
